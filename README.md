# zsh-themes

Do you enjoy custom zsh themes? Do you also enjoy burgers? Then I have got the custom zsh theme for you: `burger`! It is based on the [af-magic](https://github.com/andyfleming/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/af-magic.zsh-theme) theme by [Andy Fleming](https://github.com/andyfleming/) with the main difference that it also has a burger. Try it (if you like burgers)!
